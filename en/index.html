                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>I am a happy person. I have been doing what I love for over 25 years. I have a deep understanding of the physiology behind organ dysfunction and the development of diagnoses.</p>
                    <p>That's why I can easily and simply help solve issues related to health, weight loss, rejuvenation, and boosting immunity in both adults and children. My name is Iryna. I love meeting people.</p>
                    <p>I believe that people don't cross paths in this life by chance. I help those who already have health concerns. And I especially love and rejoice when people reach out before diagnoses have formed.</p>
                    <p>Everyone in medicine knows that any diagnosis takes 6-8 years to form, and for joints, it's 10-12 years. If you're ready to preserve or restore your joints, restore the function of your intestines, liver, heart, clear your skin, improve the function of male and female reproductive organs, easily shed excess weight through lipolysis and fat burning at night, address rejuvenation issues, prepare for pregnancy, and receive the main bonus – years plus, age minus. Come to me.</p>
                    <p>Individual approach, support until results are achieved with a specialist-consultant-rehabilitologist. See you soon!</p>
